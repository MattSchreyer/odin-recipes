    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe involves a customizable dish with primarily meat as a protein rolled into a flour tortilla; I particularly enjoy putting mexican cheese
        and lettuce on my tacos! :)
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 oz.) carton Campbell's Mexican Style Tomato Soup</li>
        <li>12 taco shells, warmed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup diced tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the beef in a 12 inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. 
            Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir the soup in the skillet and heat to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the soup is reduced, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Divide the beef among the taco shells. Top with the lettuce, tomato and cheese.</li>
    </ol>
