    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe makes a classic New York-style cheesecake with a buttery graham cracker crust and rich, dense filling made from cream cheese, 
        eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla, a hint of lemon, and a few tablespoons of flour. The flour might seem like an unusual addition, 
        but it's the secret to success: a little starch helps prevent the cake from cracking and also makes the filling just a bit lighter.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tbs. butter, melted</li>
        <li>32 oz. cream cheese</li>
        <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tbs. vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9 inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.</li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. 
            Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. 
            Chill in refrigerator until serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
